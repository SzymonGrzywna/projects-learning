Hi, I'm Szymon I've spent the last few years managing a retail store, leading a team, and keeping operations running smoothly. But after hours? I dive head-first into the world of tech, data, and automation.

I'm transitioning into IT. Every day, I learn Python, build automations in Make.com, analyze data with Pandas, test AI models and APIs, and focus on practical skills I want to use professionally.

My main project? An AI assistant for real estate investors and agents. It:

– scrapes listings (BeautifulSoup)
– analyzes data (Pandas + XGBoost)
– scores opportunities
– shows results via Streamlit
– stores data in MongoDB
– sends alerts via email / Telegram when deals show up

It’s my way of learning by building – and maybe even shaping my future.

My 2025 goal: switch careers and land a job in tech. I'm aiming for roles like:

– Junior Python Developer
– Data Analyst / Data Automation Specialist
– No-Code Automation Expert

 I'm documenting my journey from scratch – from print("Hello World") and Git basics to building real tools. If you’re curious whether you can still break into tech from zero – follow along.

I’ll be sharing my progress, lessons learned, mistakes made, and updates on my AI bot for the real estate world.

And yes, I still work full-time, travel often, and learn during breaks – but every day I take one more step toward a new career.

Looking for someone with real-world mindset, team leadership skills, and a practical approach to learning? Let’s connect.

2025 is my year. I’m betting on it.Hi, I'm Szymon I've spent the last few years managing a retail store, leading a team, and keeping operations running smoothly. But after hours?
